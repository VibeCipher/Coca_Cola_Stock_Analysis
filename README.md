# Coca_Cola_Stock_Analysis
This project analyzes Coca-Cola stock data using Python. It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) and time-series insights using various statistical and visualization techniques.
Features
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Data preprocessing (scaling, train-test split)
Regression models: SVR, Decision Trees, Random Forest
Deep learning with LSTM for time-series forecasting
Performance evaluation (Mean Squared Error, visualizations)
Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow keras
```
Visualizations
Includes stock price trends, model performance comparisons, and deep learning predictions.
Machine Learning Models
Several regression models are used to predict stock prices:
Support Vector Regression (SVR) – Handles non-linearity in stock trends.
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) – A simple and efficient linear model.
Decision Tree Regressor – Captures complex patterns in price movements.
Random Forest Regressor – An ensemble method to improve predictions.
Performance Evaluation
Each model is evaluated using:
Mean Squared Error (MSE) – Measures prediction accuracy.
Visualization of actual vs. predicted prices – Helps assess performance.
